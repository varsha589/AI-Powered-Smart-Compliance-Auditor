# AI-Powered Smart Compliance Auditor

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Smart Compliance Auditor** is an intelligent system designed to **automate regulatory compliance auditing** in industries such as **finance, healthcare, and legal sectors**. It leverages **AI, NLP, and RPA** to analyze business processes, identify compliance risks, and suggest corrective actions.

### Project Status: **Under Development**
This project is currently in the **planning phase**, and features are **yet to be implemented**. Future updates will include AI-driven compliance checking, automated risk detection, and remediation suggestions.

## Features (Planned)
 **Automated Document Processing** – AI extracts compliance clauses from legal and business documents.  
 **Regulatory Cross-Check** – Compares extracted clauses with compliance databases (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS).  
**Risk Detection & Alerts** – ML models detect violations and flag them for review.  
**Automated Remediation Suggestions** – AI recommends corrective actions based on past cases.  
**Conversational AI for Compliance Queries** – Users can ask compliance-related questions and get AI-driven responses.  

**These features are yet to be implemented.**
